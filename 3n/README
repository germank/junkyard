                Usage: ./summarize.py <output filenames>.
                [Note: very memory-inefficient prototype code. Needs lots of RAM]
chunker.py      Helper script to find intervals [a, b] which take roughly the same processing work.
output.tar.bz2  Results from a large cluster run. "out.$a-$b" contains results of "./p $a $b"
clustrun.py     Creates a makefile to process several chunks in parallel on a multicore system.
                It was used as part of a process which produced the files in output.tar.bz2.

Code has been tested on 64-bit FreeBSD and Linux.
