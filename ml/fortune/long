Three statisticians went hunting with bow and arrow. After a while, they
came to a beautiful little clearing where a magnificent buck was grazing
just in the middle. The first statistician let his arrow fly, but it missed
by about a foot to the right of the buck. The second statustician then took
a shot, but his arrow went wide by about a foot on the left. At that point,
the third statistician shouted, ecstatic: "We got him!"

The Ten Commandments of Statistical Inference
  I.	 Thou shalt not hunt statistical significance with a shotgun.
  II.	 Thou shalt not enter the valley of the methods of inference without an experimental design.
  III.	 Thou shalt not make statistical inference in the absence of a model.
  IV.	 Thou shalt honor the assumptions of the model.
  V.	 Thou shalt not adulterate thy model to obtain significant results.
  VI.	 Thou shalt not covet thy colleague's data.
  VII.	 Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy control-group.
  VIII.	 Thou shalt not worship the 0.05 significance level.
  IX.	 Thou shalt not apply large-sample approximations in vain.
  X.	 Thou shalt not infer causal relationships from statistical significance.

Ashley-Perry Statistical Axioms:
  1. Numbers are tools, not rules.
  2. Numbers are symbols for things; the numbers and the things are not the same.
  3. Skill in manipulating numbers is a talent, not evidence of divine guidance.
  4. Like other occult techniques of divination, the statistical method has
     a private jargon deliberately contrived to obscure its methods from
     nonpractitioners.
  5. The product of an arithmetical computation is the answer to an equation;
     it is not the solution to a problem.
  6. Arithmetical proofs of theorems that do not have arithmetical bases
     prove nothing.
